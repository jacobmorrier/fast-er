Deduplication
=============

This class represents our main contribution, as it performs the GPU-accelerated computation of the `Jaro-Winkler similarity metric <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroâ€“Winkler_distance>`_ for each pair of values in the dataset. In addition to fuzzy matching based on the Jaro-Winkler similarity metric, the class also supports comparing variables for exact matching.

For reference, the Jaro-Winkler similarity is a continuous measure that ranges from 0 to 1. The similarity between two strings, :math:`s_1` and :math:`s_2`, is calculated using the following formula:

.. math::

    \mathcal{S}(s_1, s_2) = \mathcal{J}(s_1, s_2) + w \times \ell \times \left(1 - \mathcal{J}(s_1, s_2)\right),

where:

.. math::

    \mathcal{J}(s_1, s_2) = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{m}{\left|s_1\right|} + \frac{m}{\left|s_2\right|} + \frac{m-\frac{t}{2}}{m}\right).

In these equations, :math:`\left|s\right|` denotes the length of the string :math:`s`, :math:`m` is the number of matching characters between the strings, and :math:`t` is the number of transpositions between matching characters. Furthermore, :math:`\ell` (ranging from 0 to 4) represents the number of consecutive matching characters at the beginning of both strings, and :math:`w` (ranging from 0 to 0.25) is the weight assigned to :math:`\ell`. We discretize the Jaro-Winkler similarity so that the values of the agreement vectors :math:`\mathbf{\gamma}` are integers between 0 and :math:`L-1`, with higher integer values reflecting a greater similarity. In practice, we categorize the Jaro-Winkler similarity into three levels, using two thresholds to define these partitions.
