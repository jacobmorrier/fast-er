Linkage
=======

This class integrates the outputs from the :doc:`Comparison <comparison>` and :doc:`Deduplication <deduplication>` classes with the parameters of the Fellegi-Sunter model estimated by the :doc:`Estimation <estimation>` class, using the latter to identify the records most likely to refer to the same unit of observation.
